## Component Naming Conventions

We follow a simple, HTML-like naming approach. Component names should be as short and intuitive as possible, mirroring native HTML elements where applicable.

### Core Principles

1. **Keep Names Simple**

   - Use the most obvious, shortest name that describes the component
   - If a native HTML element exists, use its name (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Select`)
   - Avoid unnecessary prefixes or categorization

2. **File Structure**
   - Files and folders match the component name exactly
   - Example: `Button` component lives in `Button/Button.tsx`
   - All exports are through `index.ts` files

### Examples

```tsx
// ✅ Good
Button;
Input;
Select;
Label;
Avatar;
Badge;
Card;
Modal;
Tooltip;
ActionSplit;
ActionGroup;

// ❌ Avoid
ActionButton;
InputText;
DisplayBadge;
LayoutContainer;
FormSelect;
```

### Compound Names

When additional context is needed, combine words naturally:

- `ActionSplit` for a button with dropdown
- `ActionGroup` for grouped buttons
- `FormField` for a form input container

Remember: Always choose the simplest name that clearly describes the component's purpose.
