# Atomic Design System

## Introduction

Our design system is built using Atomic Design methodology, a systematic approach to creating design systems. This methodology breaks down interfaces into five distinct levels. For detailed guidance on how to classify components, please refer to our [Decision Flow Guide](./AtomicDesignDecisionFlow.mdx).

1. **Atoms**: The basic building blocks of matter, applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input, or a button.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.
3. **Organisms**: Groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
4. **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.

## Component Categories

### Input Components
Input components are the building blocks for user interaction and data collection.

- **Input**: Basic text input field
- **Checkbox**: Checkbox input for boolean values
- **Select**: Dropdown selection component
- **Label**: Form label component
- **Required**: Required field indicator
- **InputForm**: Form wrapper component

### Action Components
Action components are interactive elements that trigger specific behaviors.

- **Button**: Primary interactive button component
- **ActionAvatar**: User avatar with interactive capabilities
- **ActionButtonSplit**: Button with multiple actions

### Display Components
Display components are used to present information and status.

- **Badge**: Small status indicators
- **DisplayAlert**: Notification and alert messages
- **Tooltip**: Contextual information tooltips

### Layout Components
Layout components help structure the page and manage spacing.

- **LayoutAspectRatio**: Component for maintaining aspect ratios
- **LayoutSeparator**: Visual divider between content

## Component Hierarchy

### Atoms
Atoms are the smallest, most basic components that can't be broken down further without losing their functionality.

```tsx
// Example of an atom component
<Input
  name="username"
  label="Username"
  placeholder="Enter your username"
/>
```

### Molecules
Molecules are combinations of atoms that form more complex components.

```tsx
// Example of a molecule component
<InputForm>
  <Label htmlFor="username">Username</Label>
  <Input id="username" />
  <Required required />
</InputForm>
```

### Organisms
Organisms are complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms.

```tsx
// Example of an organism component
<LoginForm>
  <InputForm>
    <Label htmlFor="username">Username</Label>
    <Input id="username" />
    <Required required />
  </InputForm>
  <Button>Login</Button>
</LoginForm>
```

## Accessibility Considerations

All components in our design system are built with accessibility in mind:

- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management
- Error handling and messaging

## Usage Guidelines

### Input Components
- Always pair inputs with labels
- Use Required for required fields
- Provide clear error messages
- Support keyboard navigation

### Action Components
- Use appropriate button variants
- Provide clear feedback on interaction
- Ensure sufficient touch targets
- Support keyboard activation

### Display Components
- Use appropriate color schemes
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Support responsive layouts

## Best Practices

1. **Component Composition**
   - Build complex components by composing simpler ones
   - Maintain clear component hierarchy
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose

2. **State Management**
   - Use controlled components where appropriate
   - Provide clear state management patterns
   - Document component state requirements

3. **Styling**
   - Use consistent spacing and sizing
   - Follow the design system's color palette
   - Maintain responsive design principles

4. **Documentation**
   - Document component props and usage
   - Provide clear examples
   - Include accessibility considerations

## Getting Started

To use components from our design system:

1. Import the required component:
```tsx
import { Input } from '@/components/atoms/Input';
```

2. Use the component with appropriate props:
```tsx
<Input
  name="username"
  label="Username"
  placeholder="Enter your username"
  required
/>
```

3. Customize as needed using the provided props and styling options.

## Contributing

When contributing to the design system:

1. Follow the atomic design methodology
2. Maintain accessibility standards
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Include appropriate tests
5. Follow the established naming conventions
