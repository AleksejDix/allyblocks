# Storybook Story Rules

1. Never add explicit title to stories component metadata
2. All stories should be named after the file hierarchy automatically
3. Use the component name for the default export
4. Use descriptive names for story variants

# Testing Rules

5. Never test implementation details
6. Never test visual features
7. Tests should be semantic and treat components like a black box

# Component Development Rules

8. Before creating a new component, check if a suitable component already exists in the components folder (atoms, molecules, organisms)

# Documentation Rules

9. Document all props with their types, defaults, and descriptions
10. Include usage examples in component documentation
11. Document any accessibility considerations specific to the component

# Design Principles

12. Follow atomic design principles - atoms for basic elements, molecules for combinations, and organisms for complex components
13. Ensure components are responsive and work across all target device sizes
14. Maintain consistent styling with the design system
15. Reuse existing design tokens instead of hardcoding values

# Performance Rules

16. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
17. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using memoization where appropriate
18. Lazy load large components when possible
